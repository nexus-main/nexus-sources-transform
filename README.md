# Nexus.Sources.Transform

It is often necessary to shorten resource names, extract units from resource names, set resource group memberships, or perform other transformations on the original resource catalog. This package provides these (and more) features and removes the need for individual Nexus extensions to implement them themselves.

The idea is to place this source at the end in the Nexus pipeline.
